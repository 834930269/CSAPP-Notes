## Thread Level Parallelism

### Lessons Learned

- Must have parallelization strategy
  - Pratition into K independent parts
  - Divide-and-conquer
- Inner loops must be synchronization free
  - Synchronization operations very expenstive
- Beware of Amdahl's Law
  - Serial code can become bottleneck
