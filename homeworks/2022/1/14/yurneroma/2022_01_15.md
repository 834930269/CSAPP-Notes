	- Operate under fundamental constraint
		- Must not casue any change in program behavior
			- Except, possibly when program making use of nonstandard language features
		- Often prevents it from making optimizaitons that would only affect behavior under pathological conditions
	- Behavior that  may be obvious to the programmer can be obfuscated by languages and coding styles
	- Most analysis is performed only within procedures
	- Most analysis is based only on static information
	- When in doubt , the compiler must be conservative
