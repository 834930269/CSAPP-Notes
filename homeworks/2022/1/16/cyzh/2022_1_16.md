## Storage technologies and trends

### Random-Access Memory

#### Disk Geometry

- Disk consist of **platters**, each with two **surfaces**
- Each surface consists of concentric rings called **tracks**
- Each track consists of **sectors** separated by **gaps**

#### Disk Capacity

Vendors express capacity in units of gigabytes(GB), where 1 GB = $10^9$Bytes.

#### Solid State Dicks(SSDs)

![ssd](.\ssd.png)

- Pages: 512KB to 4KB, Blocks: 32 to 128 KB pages
- Data read/written in units of pages
- Page can be written only after its block has been erase
- A block wears out after 100,000 repeated write

#### The CPU memory Gap

## Locality of reference

## Cashing in the memory hierarchy



## Summary

- The speed gap between CPU, memory and mass storage continues to widen
- Well-written programs exhibit a property called locality.
- Memory hierarchies based on cashing close the gap by exploiting locality.
