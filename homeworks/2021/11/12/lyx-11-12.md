# Machine Code

# Basics

1. Architecture: The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand or write assembly/machine code. (instruction set specification, registers)
2. Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architecture. (cache sizes and core frequency)
3. Code Forms:
    1. Machine Code: the byte-level programs that a processor executes
    2. Assembly code: A text representation of machine code
4. compiler → assembler → linker
5. Assembly Characteristics: Data Types
    1. Integer data of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes
    2. Floating point data of 4, 8, or 10 bytes
    3. No aggregate types such as arrays or structs
6. Assembly Characteristics: Operations
    1. Perform arithmetic function on register or memory data
    2. Transfer data between memory and register 
    3. Transfer control
7. C code
    
    ```c
    *dest = t
    ```
    
    Assembly code
    
    ```c
    movq %rax, (%rbx)
    ```
    
    move from one register to another
    
    Object code
    
    In this case, it only takes three bytes to write that particular instruction 
    
    ```c
    0x40059e: 48 89 03
    ```
    

# Assembly Code

1. Programmer-Visible State
    1. Program Counter: Address of the next instruction
    2. Register file: Heavily used program data
    3. Condition codes:
        1. Store status info about the most recent arithmetic or logical operation
        2. Used for conditional branching
    4. Memory
        1. Byte addressable array
        2. Code and user data
        3. Stack to support procedures
2. An x86-64 central processing unit contains a set of 16 general-purpose registers strong 64-bit values. These registers are used to store integer data as well as pointed. 
3.  mov class consists of four instructions: movb, move, movl, movq. All four of these instructions have similar effects and they differ primarily in that they operate on data of different sizes: 1, 2, 4, 9 bytes respectively. q refers to a quad word, where a word is of size 2 bytes.
4. moving data:
    1. movq Soruce, Dest
    2. Operand Types:
        1. Immediate: constant integer data
        2. Register: specially named memory location
        3. Memory: 8 consecutive bytes of memory at the address given by registers

    d. Simple Memory Addressing Modes:
    
    1. R corresponds to Mem[Reg[R]]
        1. movq (%rcx), %rax, this corresponds to pointer dereferencing in C
    2. D(R) corresponds to Mem[Reg[R] + D]
        1. movq 8(%rbp), %rdx
    
    e. 
    
    ```c
    void swap(long *xp, long *yp){
    	long t0 = *xp;
    	long t1 = *yp;
    	*xp = t1;
    	*yp = t0;
    }
    
    swap:
    	movq (%rdi), %rax
    	movq (%rsi), %rdx
    	movq %rds, (%rdi)
    	movq %rax, (%rsi)
      ret
    ```
    
    ret returns you to wherever the calling position was. Arguments always come in some specific registers. %rdi will be the first argument register, and %rsi will be the second argument register (They are set by part of the code that defines the function). Those will be pointers which contains addresses in the memory.
    
    f. Most general form of addressing mode
    
    D(Rb, Ri, S) → Mem[Reg[Rb] + S * Reg[Ri] + D]
    
    1. D: Constant displacement of 1, 2, or 4 bytes
    2. Base Register: any of the 16 integer registers
    3. Index Register: Any, except for %rsp
    4. Scale: 1, 2, 4, or 8

     e. leaq Src, Dst

  i. Src is address mode expression

  ii. Set Dst to address denoted by expression

```c
long m12(long x){
    return x *12;
}
```

is equivalent to 

```
leaq (%rdi, %rdi, 2), %rax
salq $2, %rax
```
