# Floating Point

1. Numerical Form: $(-1)^{s}M2^{E}$
    1. significand $M$ normally a fractional value in range $[1.0, 2.0]$
    2. Exponent $E$ weighs value by a power of two
    3. E = exponent - bias 
2. Floating Point Operations: Basic Idea
    1. x + y = round(x + y)
    2. x * y = round(x * y)
    3. Four kinds of rounding: 
        1. towards zero
        2. round down
        3. round up
        4. nearest even(default):
            1. if you have a value that's strictly more than halfway between two numbers, then round up
            2. if you have a value that's strictly less than halfway between two numbers, then round down 
            3. otherwise round to the nearest even number
            4. binary fractional numbers: 
                1. "Even" when the least significant bit is 0
                2. "half way" when bits to the right of rounding position = 100...
3. Floating Point in C
    1. double/float → int
        1. Truncates fractional part
        2. Like rounding toward zero
        3. Not defined when out of range
    2. int → double
        1. exact conversion, as long as int has ≤ 53bit word size
    3. int → foat
        1.  will round according to rounding mode
