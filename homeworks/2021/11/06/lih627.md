##  Floating Point

Floating-point number encodes rational numbers of the form $V = x\times 2^y$. 
$$
b = \sum_{i = -n}^m 2^i \times b_i
$$
**IEEE Floating-Point Representation**

The IEEE strandard $V = (-1)^s\times M\times 2^E$.

- $s$ determine the number is negative or positive.
- *significand* $M$ is a fractional binary number that ranges either between 1 and $2 - \epsilon$ or between 0 and $1 -\epsilon$ .
- *exponent* $E$ weights the value by a (positive or negative) power of 2.
