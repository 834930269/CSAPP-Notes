## 3.9 Heterogeneous Data Structure 

C provides two mechanisms: structures and unoins.

To access the fields of a structure, the coompiler generates code that adds the appropriate offset to the address of the structure.

```
struct rec {
    int i;
    int j;
    int a[2];
    int *p;
};
```

Supposed we have a struct rec* in register rdi. Then we can access the i and j as follows:

```
    movl (%rdi), %eax // get r->i
    movl %eax, 4(%rax) // store in r->j
```

For the `a[2]`, the access will be in one instruction:

```
leaq 8(%rdi, %rsi, 4), %rax // rax = r->a[i]
```

### practice 3.41

A: p: 0 s.x:8 x.y: 10 next:12

B: 20bytes

C: 

```c
// st in rdi
void st_init(struct test *st) {
    // eax = (st->x << 16) + st->y; 
    st->y = eax; // st->s.x solution seems incorrect as movl is 32-bits rather than 16 bits;
    // rax = 10 + st;
    st->p = &st->y; // &(st->s.y)
    st->next = st;
}
```
