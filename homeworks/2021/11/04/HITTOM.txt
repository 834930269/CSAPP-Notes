2.2.6 expand numbers
#define INT_MIN (-INT_MAX - 1) // right
#define INT_MIN -2147483648 // wrong ?
#define INT_MIN 0x80000000 // wrong ?
short x = -1
unsigned ux = x; // ux = (unsigned)(int)(x) = 0xFFFFFFFF, not (unsigned int)(unsigned short)x = 0x0000FFFF

2.2.7 truncating numbers
just so so

2.2.8 
other languages consider unsigned as more trouble than worth
