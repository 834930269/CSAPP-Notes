# Machine Code

1. Architecture: The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand or write assembly/machine code. (instruction set specification, registers)
2. Microarchitecture: Implementation of the architecture. (cache sizes and core frequency)
3. Code Forms:
    1. Machine Code: the byte-level programs that a processor executes
    2. Assembly code: A text representation of machine code
4. compiler → assembler → linker
5. Assembly Characteristics: Data Types
    1. Integer data of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes
    2. Floating point data of 4, 8, or 10 bytes
    3. No aggregate types such as arrays or structs
6. Assembly Characteristics: Operations
    1. Perform arithmetic function on register or memory data
    2. Transfer data between memory and register 
    3. Transfer control
