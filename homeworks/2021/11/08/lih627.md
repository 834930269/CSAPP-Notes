- $s$ single sing bit. 31st bit in figure
- The k bit $exp=e_{k-1}\cdots e_1e_0$ encodes the exponent E
- The n bit $frac = f_{n-1}\cdots f_1f_0$ encodes the significant M. The value has relationship with E

**Normalized Values**

The bits of exp are neighter all 0s nor all 1s. $E = e - bias$, $e$ is the unsinged value of bits. $bias = 2^{k -1}-1$, 127 for single precision.  So the E range is $[-126, 2^k -2 - 2^{k - 1} + 1 = 127]$. 

The fraction filed $frac$ is interpreted as representing the fractional value $f$ $0\le f< 1$. The binary  representation $0.f_{n-1}f_{n-2}\cdots f_1f_0$. The significand is defined to be $M = 1 + f$, So $M \in [1, 2)$
