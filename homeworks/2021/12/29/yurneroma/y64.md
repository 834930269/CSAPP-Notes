# Y86-64 Instrcution Set

1. y64 processor based on sequential operation, this processor executes a complete instruction on every clock cycle
2. whith sequential design as a basis, we then create a pipelined processor. this processor breaks the execution of each instuction into 5 steps, each of which is handled by a separated section or stage of the hardware.
3.  Instructions progress through the stages of the pipeline, with one instruction entering in the pipeline on each clock cycle. As a Result, the processor can be executing the different steps of up to 5 instructions simultangeously.
