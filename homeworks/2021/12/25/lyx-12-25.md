# Procedures

## X86 - 64 Stack

1. Region of memory managed with stack discipline
2. Grows toward lower address
3. Register %rsp contains the lowest stack address
4. pushq Src
    1. Fetch operand at Src
    2. Decrement %rsp by 8
    3. Write operand at address given by %rsp
5. popq Dest
    1. Read value at address given by %rsp
    2. Increment %rsp by 8
    3. Store value at Dest (must be register)

## Calling Conventions

### Passing Control

Recall that %rip is the program counter

the callq instruction 

1. decrement the stack pointer
2. write the address of the instruction following the call on to the top of the stack, so when the call ends it can resume back to the next instruction
3. set the program counter to the starting address of the called instructions

## Passing Data

Other arguments are stored in memory. Register access is way faster than the memory access. 

## Managing Local Data

1. Caller Stack Frame
    1. Return address
        1. Pushed by call instruction
    2. Arguments for this call

1. Can register be used for temporary storage?
    1. Needed some coordination and there is a set of conventions for problems alike.
2. Conventions
    1. Caller Saved: Caller saves temporary values in its frame before the call
    2. Callee Saved:
        1. Callee saves temporary values in its frame before using
        2. Callee restores them before returning to the caller
