# Procedures

## X86 - 64 Stack

1. Region of memory managed with stack discipline
2. Grows toward lower address
3. Register %rsp contains the lowest stack address
4. pushq Src
    1. Fetch operand at Src
    2. Decrement %rsp by 8
    3. Write operand at address given by %rsp
5. popq Dest
    1. Read value at address given by %rsp
    2. Increment %rsp by 8
    3. Store value at Dest (must be register)

## Calling Conventions

### Passing Control

Recall that %rip is the program counter

the callq instruction 

1. decrement the stack pointer
2. write the address of the instruction following the call on to the top of the stack, so when the call ends it can resume back to the next instruction
3. set the program counter to the starting address of the called instructions
