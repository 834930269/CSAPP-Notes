2.1.4 representing string
    string in C: arrays of characters, ended with null.
    some standard encoding, most common: ascii, null -> 0x00, independent with byte ordering and word size
2.1.5 representing code
    machine code: different, incompatible
2.1.6 Boolean Algebra
2.1.7 bit-level operations in c
2.1.8 logical operations
2.1.9 shift operations:
    associate from left to right: x<<j<<k = (x<<j)<<k
    two kinds of right shift:
        logical: padding with 0
        arithmetic: padding with the most significant bit
        C doesn't define clearly which to use, Java: >> arithmetic, >>> logical
2.2 integer presentation 
    2.2.0 two different ways to encode integers: nonnegative, positive zero negative
    2.2.1 integer data types
        char short long, signed unsigned
