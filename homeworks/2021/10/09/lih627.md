Admdahl’s Law. 

To analyze the speed up part influence to whole system. A general principle for improving any process.

 $T$ application requires time. $\alpha$ the fraction of curren part(significant), $k$ performace improvement.
$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{\text{new}} &= (1 - \alpha) T_{\text{old}} + (\alpha T_{\text{old}})/k \\
& = T_{\text{old}}\left[(1-\alpha) + \alpha / k \right]
\end{aligned}
$$
