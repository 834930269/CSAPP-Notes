**Representing Strings**

String in C is a an array of characters terminated by the NULL(value = 0).

```c
const char *m = "abece";
```

**Representing Codes**

The code can be represent by bytes. The context is its machine-level instructions.

**Boolean Algebra**

bit vector can represent for subset:
$$
A = \{0, 1, \cdots, w - 1\}\\
\text{mask} = [a_{w - 1}, \cdots, a_1, a_0]\ a_i = 1\text{ if } i\in A
$$
mask is used to select a subset of bits within a word. E.g.  `work & 0xFF` for the low-order byte of a word.
