## Rounding

For a value x, we want a systematic method of finding the "closest" matching value x' that can be represented in the desired floating point format.

Round-to-even - find the cloest match. When rounding values that are halfway between two possible results - round the number upward or downward such that the least significant digit of the result is even. This method avoids the statistical bias.
