2.1.9 Shift Operations in C
i << j << k === (i << j) << k
logical right shift: 1100 --> 0110
arithmetic right shift: 1100 --> 1110(-4 --> -2)
most compilers use arithmetic right shift for signed data, and many programmers assume this
Java: x >> k(arithmetic), x >>> k(logic)
a << k === a << (k mod w) on most machines, but is not guaranteed in c
