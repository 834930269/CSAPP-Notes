Multiprocessor: Multi-core + Hyper-threaded

Hyperthreading, or *simultaneous multi-threading*, allow a single CPU to execute multiple flows of control. In fig, a Core have multiple copies of the hardware, e.g PC and register files. When a thread is waiting for data loading, the Core can execute another thread. (四核八线程)

The advantages of multiprocessing:

1. Reduce the need to simulate concurrency.
2. Run a single application program faster. (If the program is expressed in multiple threads)

*Instruction-Level Parallelism* (指令集并行)

Modern processors execute multiple instructions at one time. E.g. pipelining

*Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data(SIMD) Parallelism*

A single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel. E.g. add 8 pairs of single-precision ﬂoating-point numbers (C data type float) in parallel.
