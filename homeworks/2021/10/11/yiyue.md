_uniprocessor system_ - a single processor to engage in multiple tasks concurrently
_multiprocessor system_ - a system consisting of multiple processors all under the control of a single operating system kernel
_hyperthreading_ - a technique that allows a single CPU to execute multiple flows of control
_instruction-level parallelism_ - modern processors can execute multiple instructions at one time
_single-instruction, multiple-data_ (SIMD) parallelism - a single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel
_instruction set architecture_ - an abstraction of the actual processor hardware. A machine-code program behaves as if it were executed on a processor that performs just one instruction at a time
