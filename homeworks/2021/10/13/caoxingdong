2.2.7 truncating numbers
    truncating a  number will remove the first w-k bits, can alter the value, overflow
    truncating an unsigned number: x' = x mod 2^k
    Truncation of a two’s-complement number: x' = U2Tk(x mod 2k).

2.3 integer arithmetic
    Unsigned Addition
        Unsigned Addition
            x + y => (x + y) mod 2^w

         Detecting overflow of unsigned addition
            s < x or s < y

        Unsigned negation
            -x => 2^w - x


    Two’s-complement addition
        Two’s-complement addition
            x + y => (x + y - 2^w) or (x + y) or (x + y + 2^w)

        Detecting overflow in two’s-complement addition
            x > 0 y > 0 s < 0 or x < 0 y < 0 s > 0
