_bytes_ - blocks of 8 bits, the smallest addressable unit of memory
_virtual memory_ - a very large array of bytes viewed by machine-level program
_address_ - every byte of memory identified by a unique number
_virtual address space_ - the set of all possible addresses
_word size_ - nominal size of pointer data
most 64-bit machines can run programs compiled fro 32-bit machines
_little endian_ - order least significant byte to most
_big endian_ most significant bytes first
_disassembler_ - a tool that determines the instruction sequence represented by an executable program file
_program counter_ the address of the next instruction to be execcuted
A program, from the perspective of the machine, is a sequence of bytes
