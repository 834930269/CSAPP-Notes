# Information Storage

Most computers use blocks of 8 bits(byte) as the smallest addressable unit of memory. The array of bytes forms *virtual memory*. Every byte of memory is identified. by a unique number(address). The all the addresses forms the virtual address space.

The machine-level program treats each program object as a block of bytes. 

**Hexadecimal Notation** 0x00 to 0xFF (0~255)

**Data Sizes**

*world* size is the nominal size of pointer data. The world size determines the maximum size of virtual address space. from 0 to $2^w - 1$

`int32_t` and `int64_t` have exactly 4 and 8 bytes respectively. (helpful for data representations and transmissions).

Without `unsigned` prefix, the data is signed, except the `char` type.
