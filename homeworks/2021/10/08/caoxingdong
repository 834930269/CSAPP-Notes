2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering
    little endian:  least significant byte comes first
    big endian: most significant byte comes first
    In most applications, byte ordering is invisible. In some cases, it becomes an issue. 
        binary data is communicated over networks between different computers. (code written for network applications must follow established conventions for byte ordering)
        when inspecting machine-level programs, look at the bytes representation of an integer.
        program are written to circumvent the type system. Use cast or union to change to data type in C (discouraged but useful). Print the bytes storing the integer/float one by one, we can find most machines use little endian.
