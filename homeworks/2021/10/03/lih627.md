**Cache**

slower = larger -> faster = smaller.

1. L1 cache. Tens of tohusands of bytes. Access speed ~ access register file.
2. L2 cache. Hundreds of thousands to million of bytes. 5x longer than L1.
3. DRAM: Main memory
4. Local secondary storage.(local disks.)

L1, L2 are SRAM(static random access memory).SRAM is used to save the date we access high-frequency. We can speed up the program, if we understand the hierarchy stroage devices.

**Operating System**

1. Protect the hardware
2. Package different underlying layers into a unified interface
