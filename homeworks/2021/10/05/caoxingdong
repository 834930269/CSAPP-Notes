1.9 Important themes
    1.9.1 Amdahlâ€™s Law
    1.9.2 Concurrency and Parallelism
        concurrency: a system with multiple, simultaneous activities; parallelism: the use of concurrency to make the system run faster. parallelism at different levels:
            Thread-Level Concurrency
                thread: have multiple control flows executing within a single process.

            Instruction-Level Parallelism:
                execute multiple instructions at one time

            Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism: a single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel


    1.9.3 importance of abstraction
        instruction set architecture provides an abstraction of the actual processor hardware
        files, virtual memory, process, virtual machine
