OS basic: processes, vitrual memory and files.

**Process**

1. OS abstraction for a runing program. Processes have exclusive use of both the processor, main memory and I/O devices.
2. Processes can run concurrently. Instructions of multi processes run interleavedly. In a single core CPU, the mechanism is named as *context switching*:
   1. Shell carries out *system call*, pass control to OS
   2. OS saves shellâ€™s context, create new process with its context, pass contral to new process
   3. New process terminates, OS restore the context of shell process and passes contral back.
   4. Shell waits for new command-line input.
3. Multi-core processor can execute serveral programs simultaneously.

**Threads**

In modern systems, a process can consist multiple execution units(*threads*).  Threads are running in the same contex of process and sharing the same code, global data. Threads used for concurrency, typically more eddicient than processes.
