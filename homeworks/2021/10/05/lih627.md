Basic opration of CPU:

- Load: copy wod from main memory into a register(寄存器).
- Store: inverse of Load
- Operate: ALU preforms an arithmetic operation.
- Jump: PC point to another address.

The program `hello` execution:

![hello_o](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lih627/MyPicGo/master/imgs/20211001223048.png)

![hello_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lih627/MyPicGo/master/imgs/20211002005257.png)

1. Type `./hello` in shell program (I/O bridge).During typing, Shell read `. / h e l l o` into a register, stroes them in memory. (Main memory ? in fig)
2. Type Enter key. Shell knows the command is finished. Then load executable `hello` file whole instructions from disk to main memory. (DMA: direct memory access. Data will not pass through CPU)
3. CPU executes machine- language instructions.
