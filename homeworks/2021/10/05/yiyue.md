Cache
- L1 cache tens of thousands of bytes. Can be accessed as fast as register
- L2 cache hundreds of thousands/millions of bytes, conencted to the processor by a special bus. 5 times longer than L1
- L1 & L2 implemented with static random access memory (SRAM)

From smaller / faster to larger / slower
- Regs
- L1 cache (SRAM)
- L2 cache (SRAM)
- L3 cache (SRAM)
- main memory (DRAM)
- local secondary storage (local disks)
- remote secondary storage (distributed file system, web server)

operating system - a layer of software interposed between application program and hardware
purpose
- proctect hardware from misuse
- provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and different low-level hardware devices]

Process - operating system's abstraction for a running program
