# CSAPP 10/19 Notes
## Chapter 3. Representing and Manipulating Information
## 3.2 Program Encodings
Say we have to program: `p1.c` and `p2.c`, we can compile them using the following command:
```
linux> gcc -Og -o p p1.c p2.c
```

* `gcc` indicates the compiler we are invoking is the gcc C compiler.
