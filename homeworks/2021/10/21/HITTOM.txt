2.1.3 addressing and byte ordering
0x01234567
big endian: 01 23 45 67
little endian: 67 45 23 01
in most case, program compiled for either endian give identical class.
in some case, byte ordering counts:
1) binary data communicates by network. sending machine internal represantation --> network standard --> recieving machine internal represantation
2) look at byte sequences representing integer data
3) program written that circumvent the normal type system, such as cast or union.
printf("%.2x", 255) --> FF

2.1.4 representing strings
representation of strings is independent of byte ordering and word size convention, so is more platform independent than binary data.
