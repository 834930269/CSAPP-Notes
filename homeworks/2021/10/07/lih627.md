**Virtual Memory**

![unix virtual memory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lih627/MyPicGo/master/imgs/20211005170329.png)

Each process has the same uniform view of memory(*virtual address space*). For Linux(Figure addresses increase from bottom to the top):

1. Topmost region is reversed for OS code and data
2. Lower region holds the user process’s code and data

The regions in virtual address spaces consist:

1. Program code and data. Fixed size.
2. Heap. *run-time heap*.  Heap can expand dynamically.
3. Shared libraries. e.g, C standard library
4. Stack. At the top of the user’s virtual address space is the suer stack that the compiler uses to implement function calls. *Stack* expands and contracts dynamically during the execution of the program. (系统栈)
5. Kernel virtual memory. The top of virtual memory, contains kernel code. kernel is used to perform OS operations.
