# A Tour of Computer Systems

> You are poised for an exciting journey. If you dedicate yourself to learning the concepts in this book, then you will be on your way to becoming a rare “power programmer,” enlightened by an understanding of the underlying computer system and its impact on your application programs.

## Information Is Bits + Context

Computer system = hardware + software.

A  `hello.c` program is sotred as a sequence of bytes(1 byte = 8 bits). `\n` is NL(*newline* character). `hello.c` is a *text* file(because it only contains ASCII characters), all other files files are *binary* files.

All the things are bits, we analyze them to get the context (compilation).

`hello.o`  only has machine language instructions.
