# CSAPP 9/27 Notes
## 1.1 Information Is Bits + Context
Computer system = hardware + software.

* Every file is a sequence of bits, with values of 0 or 1. And there are two types of files:
    1. **Text file**: the bits of text file are organized in 8-bit chunks called bytes, each byte represents some text character in the program. Note that a text file contains only ASCII characters.
    2. **Binary file**: All other files are binary files.

* All information in computer systems are just bits, but the way we interpret them distinguishes different data objects.
