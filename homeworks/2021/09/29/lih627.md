Here is the hardwar structure of computer:

CPU: central processing unit.  ALU: arithmetic/logic unit PC: program counter USB: universal serial bus.

**Buses**: transfer bit information. Typically to transfer fixed-size chunks of bytes (known as words). A word = 32 bits or 64 bits.

**I/O Devices**: Input/output devices, designed for the connection between external world and computer system. e.g. keyboard, mouse, disk, etc.

**Main Memory** : Temporary storage device. It stores the program and manipulated date when processor is exceting the program. DRAM(*dynamic random access memory*)

**Processor**:  can exectues instructions stored in main memory. PC(program counter) is used to points at the address of manchine instruction in main memory. The processor executes the instruction pointed by the PC and then PC point to next instruction.  ALU(*arithmetic/logic unit*) computes data an address values. **register file** consists of word-size registers with their unique names.
