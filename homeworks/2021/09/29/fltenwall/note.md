All information in a system—including disk files, programs stored in memory, user data stored in
memory, and data transferred across a network—is represented as a bunch of bits.
The only thing that distinguishes different data objects is the context in which
we view them. For example, in different contexts, the same sequence of bytes
might represent an integer, floating-point number, character string, or machine instruction

These questions are intersting, I think we can exploer. For example, is a switch statement
always more efficient than a sequence of if-else statements? How much
overhead is incurred by a function call? Is a while loop more efficient than
a for loop? Are pointer references more efficient than array indexes? Why
does our loop run so much faster if we sum into a local variable instead of an
argument that is passed by reference? How can a function run faster when we
simply rearrange the parentheses in an arithmetic expression?
