Chapter1. A tour of computer systems
    1.0
    1.1 Information is Bits + Context
        All information in the computer systems is represented by a bunch of bits. Under different contexts, the same bytes can be viewed as different objects.
    1.2 Programs Are Translated by Other Programs into Different Forms
        In Unix System, compiler driver translates the source hello.c file into executable object program. The translation consists of 4 phrases:
            preprocessing phrase: preprocessor replace the directives started with "#" to original contents, resulting the hello.i file.
            compilation phrase: compiler translates the hello.i file into hello.s, which contains the assembly-language program.
            assembly phrase: assembler translates hello.s file into machine-language instructions, knowns as relocatable object program, into a "hello.o" file.
            linking phrase: linker merges separate library into the file, resulting an executable.
    1.3 It Pays to Understand How Compilation Systems Work
        optimize performance, link-time errors, security and vulnerability
